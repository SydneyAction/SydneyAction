I started as a volunteer  IT Technician in 2014, working with skilled and experienced IT professionals. There, I gained hands-on IT Technical skills for about a year, more especially in computer networking.
 after had obtained a diploma in IT in 2010.

During that time I was actually very enthusiastic    with  programming although I haven't got an opportunity to work as a programmer at time.As a self-motivated professional I was always self-studying and playing around programming languages such Java,Visual basics just to mention few.


At the same time was also playing around with virtualization softwares e.g. Oracle Virtualbox and Vmware where I set up  virtual networks in order to learn and explore more advanced networking skills as preparation for Cybersecurity certifications.

And during my spare time was also doing IT Technical support for schools and small offices around the Malamulele area, as a self employed IT professional which also helped me  built my experience and skills.

I continued do so until I got a job in 2016 as Fibre Optics technician at Vumatel till today.I still sustains all skills that I have acquired in 2014 through the use of virtualization softwares to create practical test environments for direct exploration.

I'm currently studying for more Programming, AI ,and  cybersecurity security certifications for future with a hands-on approach.
